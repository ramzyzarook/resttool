  "how-it-works": {
    "title": "How It Works",
    "content": "CerteraRest works by allowing users to upload a JSON file containing an OpenAPI specification. Upon uploading the file, the system utilizes advanced algorithms, including techniques based on Large Language Models (LLMs), to automatically generate a comprehensive suite of test cases that cover all possible edge cases and scenarios relevant to the API. The tests are then executed automatically, and detailed reports are generated, showcasing test results, performance insights, error detection, and more. \n\nOne of the main challenges of traditional API testing tools is their dependency on manual intervention and their limited ability to handle complex, dynamic API structures. CerteraRest addresses these challenges by generating test cases on the fly, evaluating API performance in real-time, and providing detailed feedback on both functional and non-functional aspects of the API. Furthermore, the tool includes an exploratory testing mode that allows users to uncover unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities in the API, ensuring that all potential issues are addressed before deployment."

  "test-case-validation": {
    "title": "Test Case Validation and Report Accuracy",
    "content": "To ensure the accuracy and correctness of the generated test cases and the final reports, we have implemented a rigorous validation process. Here's how we validate the generated test cases and check the report for correctness:\n\n- **JSON Validation**: We use JSON validators to ensure that the structure of the generated test cases is correct. This helps verify that the test cases are correctly formatted and comply with the expected JSON schema, preventing issues related to malformed data.\n\n- **Expert Feedback**: To further validate the correctness of the test cases and reports, we reached out to industry experts and professionals with experience in API testing. These experts reviewed the generated test cases and provided valuable feedback on the reports, helping us identify areas for improvement.\n\n- **Model Fine-Tuning**: Based on the feedback we received from experts, we fine-tuned the underlying model (LLM) to further refine the test case generation process. This iterative feedback loop ensures that the model continues to improve over time, providing more accurate and relevant test cases for different API scenarios."
